name: compatible interaction, recognizable pathogen effector absent, functional host resistance gene compromised
def: "A pathogen host interaction phenotype where the gene-for-gene relationship between the pathogen and plant host results in disease susceptibility. The ability of a pathogen effector to be recognized by a specific host resistance gene is absent and the ability of a host to be resistant to a pathogen, via the recognition of a pathogen effector by a specific host resistance gene, is abolished (resistance was present and is now absent)."
